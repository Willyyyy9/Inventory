## Description

Inventory App would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products.
The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product.
It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments.


In the application you can:
* Register and save new products by assigning a name, a quantity, a unit price, a supplier and a picture of the product
